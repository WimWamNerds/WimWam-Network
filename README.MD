# GeeSome Node
GeeSome Node allows you to run your own file storage with social media functional: 
make you own public or private group with posts and content.
It's a Node on top of IPFS for define and manage data structure of files, users and groups.
Node provides a UI for storing and accessing your saved data or remote data of other nodes: files, posts, groups.

## About GeeSome Project
GeeSome protocol created to provide communication tool between communities of property owners in Galt Project. 

Galt Project team is aware of many cases of censorship and blocking in different social networks. These cases forced us to develop a new decentralized protocol and node application that would allow anyone to upload any content to his personal node and to share this content with the whole world without the risk of being blocked.

Using the GeeSome protocol, communities in the Galt Project will be able to communicate in encrypted chat groups, share images, video, text or any data.

We are sure that this tool should be used not only by the project's communities, but also by anyone who is concerned about the safety of their data, censorship and blocking in web.

## GeeSome Protocol
A new open protocol for unstopable social networking and communication on IPFS.
It defines the structure of social network data to describe familiar to the modern user entities: content, posts, tags, groups.

## GeeSome UI
GeeSome UI - it's Vue application, that using GeeSome node API for saving content and IPFS in-browser node for getting content. It's completly separated client from node and can be connected to any other GeeSome node. There are also many cases when itâ€™s not necessary to use GeeSome UI. You can use GeeSome node API and GeesomeClient class in your projects for build you own UI with some important for you functions.

## Summary
With the help of GeeSome Node, anyone can create an instance of a decentralized social network, with groups like in YouTube, Instagram or Telegram but with content preservation and no locks or censorship thanks to the concept of personal GeeSome Node using IPFS Node to store content, access data and receive updates by libp2p.

GeeSome Node can be used:
- to create and maintain your blog
- to save important content like Saved messages in telegrams and / or in the form of a file structure as in Google Drive
- as a media platform for adding and viewing / listening to audio and video content, creating playlists
- to share the uploaded content in any form (blog, playlist, file, folder)
- to create chat groups

## GeeSome Scheme
![GeeSome-Scheme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4842007/68893921-d912cf00-072e-11ea-8fe4-7d2937f32342.png)

You can run personal or public GeeSome node. It used for storing files, manage entities and prepare content for publishing.
Also because of IPNS updates issues - GeeSome node have IPNS caching based on signed PubSub events. 
Also there is an [issue](https://github.com/galtproject/geesome-node/issues/115) about IPNS keys of user. 
Currently its storing in GeeSome node, but need to improve it.

## Install with domain to your server
1. Set DNS settings for domain: ip address of server
2. Clone repo to server that bound to domain
```
git clone https://github.com/galtproject/geesome-node.git && cd geesome-node
```
3. Run script with parameters: domain and email for letsencrypt
```
sudo chmod +x bash/*.sh && sudo bash/ubuntu-install-docker.sh
sudo bash/ubuntu-install-nginx.sh 
```
Recommend actions after install:
```
sudo bash/ubuntu-init-swapfile.sh # Init 2GB Swapfile
PORT=4242 bash/ubuntu-set-ssh-port.sh # Change SSH port to custom
```
4. Open your-site.com/#/setup and create first admin user

## Getting started with GeeSome Node API
1. Install GeeSome libs by npm:
```
npm i --save git://github.com/galtproject/geesome-libs.git
```
or yarn:
```
yarn add git://github.com/galtproject/geesome-libs.git
```

2. Checkout [GeeSome API documentation](https://geesome-node.galtproject.io:7722/ipns/QmQdr2fJ1qsYHnGN2FC1G9kitypiUQ271GhLa8qEtJnSN7/)

3. Get apiKey from node by api and login pass authorization:
```javascript
const { GeesomeClient } = require('geesome-libs/src/GeesomeClient');

const geesomeClient = new GeesomeClient({
    server: 'https://your-site.com:7722', // or 'http://localhost:7711',
    // apiKey: '4J1VYKW-ZP34Y0W-PREH1Q2-DYN9Q8E' // if you paste your apiKey here, so no need to authorization by loginPassword function
});

geesomeClient.init().then(async () => {
    await geesomeClient.loginPassword("username", "password");
    console.log('Congrats! You successfully authorized, your session api key:', geesomeClient.apiKey);
});
```
Or you can generate apiKey from UI in User Profile section by "Add api key" button.
More safer to use `apiKey` instead of login/password, because you can always disable it and create another if there is a leak.

4. Init GeeSome client and save image to your IPFS node
```javascript
geesomeClient.init().then(async () => {
    const contentObj = await geesomeClient.saveDataByUrl('https://picsum.photos/500/300.jpg');
    console.log('content ipfs', contentObj.storageId);
    console.log('content manifest ipld', contentObj.manifestStorageId);
});
```

5. Create group and publish post via API
```javascript
geesomeClient.init().then(async () => {
    const avatarPhoto = await geesomeClient.saveDataByUrl('https://picsum.photos/500/300.jpg');
    
    const group = await geesomeClient.createGroup(testUser.id, { name: 'test', title: 'Test', avatarImageId: avatarPhoto.id });

    const groupIpns = group.manifestStaticStorageId;
    console.log('group manifest ipld', group.manifestStorageId);
    console.log('group manifest ipns that points to ipld', groupIpns);
    
    const postContent1 = await geesomeClient.saveContentData('My first post');
    const postContent2 = await geesomeClient.saveDataByUrl('https://picsum.photos/1000/500.jpg');
    
    await geesomeClient.createPost([postContent1.id, postContent2.id], { groupId: group.id, status: 'published' });
    
    // get published group from IPFS with posts
    
    // resolve IPNS first
    const updatedGroupIpld = await geesomeClient.resolveIpns(groupIpns);
    console.log('new group manifest ipld with first post', updatedGroupIpld);
    
    // get JSON content of group by IPLD
    const updatedGroupManifest = await geesomeClient.getObject(updatedGroupIpld);
    console.log('fetched group manifest', updatedGroupManifest);
    // or you can simply use geesomeClient.getGroup(groupIpns) for auto-resolve IPNS, get manifest with avatar and cover contents included
    
    // get posts one by one from group's posts tree
    geesomeClient.getGroupPostsAsync(
      updatedGroupIpld, 
      {limit: 10, offset: 0, orderDir: 'desc'}, 
      function onItemCallback(fetchedPost) {
        console.log('fetchedPost', fetchedPost);
        console.log('fetchedPost contents array', fetchedPost.contents);
      }, 
      function onFinishCallback(postList) {
        console.log('postList', postList);
      }
    );
});
```

6. Create and publish IPFS site directory with content to IPNS
```javascript
geesomeClient.init().then(async () => {
    await geesomeClient.saveDataByUrl('https://picsum.photos/500/300.jpg', {path: '/my-site/image.jpg'});
    
    await geesomeClient.saveContentData('<h1>Hello world!</h1> <img src="./image.jpg"/>', {path: '/my-site/index.html'});
    
    const mySiteFolder = await geesomeClient.getFileCatalogItemByPath('/my-site/', 'folder');
    
    const {storageId, staticId} = await geesomeClient.publishFolder(mySiteFolder.id);
    
    console.log(`check out by IPFS hash: ${geesomeClient.server}/ipfs/${storageId}/`); // for example: https://your-site.com:7722/ipfs/QmbDxAcbnSc5bgX77MgqqZ9bPVcczv5McZAYrWXoRxExi8/

    console.log(`check out by IPNS hash: ${geesomeClient.server}/ipns/${staticId}/`); // for example: https://your-site.com:7722/ipns/QmcqRcmu7p3UHkMPz8XJ886KPWbzxgpc9uNXy9GUDfUD87/
    
    // resolve IPNS by api:
    const resolvedStorageId = await geesomeClient.resolveIpns(staticId);
    
    console.log(storageId === resolvedStorageId); // true
});
```
